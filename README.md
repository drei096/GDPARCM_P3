2. After selecting, the transform properties of the object will show up in the 'Inspector Window'.
3. Modify the values in position, rotation and scale by dragging the slider of each field.

Modifying Gameobject's components:

Adding Textures to Meshes/Primitives:
1. Once a mesh/primitive is created, select it using the Hierarchy Window.
2. Navigate the Content Browser window on the bottom of the engine window and open the Textures folder.
3. Make sure that the game object is selected
4. If it is selected, double click on the .jpg or .png file that you want as they can be applied onto the selected object.

Opening a Scene to the Editor

FOR UNITY
1. Make sure that the "exportedSceneUnity.json" file is in the Scene folder.
2. Go to SceneReader.cpp. On line 22, change "/exportedSceneUnreal" to "/exportedSceneUnity". "/exportedSceneUnreal" is used to open Unreal scenes.
3. Run the program and go to File -> Open Scene. The Unity scene will load automatically, just make sure to move the camera around.

FOR UNREAL 
1. Make sure that the "exportedSceneUnreal.json" file is in the Scene folder.
2. Go to SceneReader.cpp. On line 22, change "/exportedSceneUnity" to "/exportedSceneUnreal". "/exportedSceneUnity" is used to open Unity scenes.
3. Run the program and go to File -> Open Scene. The Unity scene will load automatically, just make sure to move the camera around.

FOR SCENES MADE IN THE EDITOR
1. Make sure that the "output.json" file is in the Scene folder.
2. Go to SceneReader.cpp. On line 22, change "/exportedSceneUnity" or "/exportedSceneUnreal" to "/output".
3. Run the program and go to File -> Open Scene. The editor scene will load automatically, just make sure to move the camera around.

Saving a Scene in the Editor
1. Once you are done creating your scene, go to File -> Save. The scene data will be saved to a JSON file.
2. To make sure that it is saved, go to the "Scene" folder of the project directory, and look for "output.json". This file can now be used for loading engine scenes to Unity, Unreal, or on this Editor.

Logging
1. Whenever a user wants to use the logging system, call BNS_Log::GetInstance()->WriteLog();
2. Make sure that "BNS_Log.h" is included in the header/cpp file on where you want to log.
3. An example is BNS_Log::GetInstance()->WriteLog(BNS_Log::Warning, "");
4. The first parameter on WriteLog is the verbosity of the log: BNS_Log::Display, BNS_Log::Warning, and BNS_Log::Error.
5. The second parameter is your log message formatted as an std::string.
